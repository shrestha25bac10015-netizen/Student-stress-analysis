Here is a short, ready‑to-use **project description** written in **points under clear topics** for *“Student Stress Analysis – A Data‑Driven Analysis of Sleep, Study Load, and Lifestyle Among Students”*.

***

## 1. Introduction

- The project focuses on understanding how sleep duration, study load, and lifestyle habits influence stress levels among students.  
- It uses a dataset of students and Python-based data analysis to find patterns and important relationships.  
- The study aims to support better academic performance and mental well‑being through data‑driven insights.

## 2. Problem Statement

- Many students experience high stress due to academic pressure, poor sleep, and unhealthy lifestyle habits.  
- This stress can affect concentration, grades, physical health, and emotional stability.  
- There is a need for a systematic, data‑driven analysis instead of only subjective opinions or isolated observations.

## 3. Objectives

- To measure and analyze student stress levels using a structured dataset.  
- To study the relationship between:
  - Sleep hours and stress level.  
  - Study hours (study load) and stress level.  
  - Lifestyle factors (such as activity, screen time, habits) and stress level.  
- To build a simple predictive model that can classify students into different stress categories (low/medium/high).  

## 4. Methodology

- Collect or use an existing dataset containing student stress, sleep, study hours, and lifestyle attributes.  
- Clean the data by removing duplicates and handling missing values, then encode categorical variables.  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using graphs such as count plots, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps.  
- Train a machine learning model (for example, Random Forest) to predict stress level from sleep, study, and lifestyle features.  
- Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix, and feature importance.

## 5. Expected Outcomes

- Identification of key factors that contribute most to high stress among students.  
- Clear visual insights showing how different sleep durations and study loads relate to stress categories.  
- A basic prediction system that can classify a student’s stress level based on their input data.  
- Practical recommendations for students and institutions on improving sleep habits, balancing study time, and adopting healthier lifestyles.

## 6. Limitations

- Results depend on the quality, size, and representativeness of the dataset used.  
- The model shows patterns and correlations but cannot fully capture all psychological or personal factors.  
- The system is intended as a support tool, not a replacement for professional counseling or medical diagnosis.
